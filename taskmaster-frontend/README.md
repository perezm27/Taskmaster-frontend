This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Lab: A Static Frontend for TaskMaster

Create a new repo taskmaster-frontend to hold your React app. Use create-react-app to generate a React app there.

## Feature Tasks

- A user should be able to visit the homepage of your React app and see the list of all tasks available in the database.
- React should be well-factored into at least 2 components.
- The homepage should have reasonable styling and layout. (Nothing too fancy, but it shouldn’t make the user cringe.)
- A user should be able to find that homepage on the Internet, deployed as a static site using S3.

## Lab: Lambda Functions

AWS Lambda allows writing code that is triggered in the cloud, without thinking about maintaining servers. We’ll use it today to automatically run some processing on image files after they’re uploaded in TaskMaster.

## Featured Tasks

- [x] A user should be able to upload an image at any size, and have both the original size and a thumbnail size associated with the task in question.
- [x] When an image is uploaded to your S3 bucket, it should trigger a Lambda function. (That Lambda function may be written in any language.)
- [x] That function should create a 50x50 pixel thumbnail version of that image, and save it to another S3 bucket. It should do so with a predictable naming convention, so that your server and/or frontend know where that thumbnail image will be.
